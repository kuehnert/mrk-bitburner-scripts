Synthetic Muscles

Initial versions of synthetic muscles weren't made of anything organic but were actually crude devices made to mimic human muscle function. Some of the early iterations were actually made of common materials such as fishing lines and sewing threads due to their high strength for a cheap cost.

As technology progressed, however, advances in biomedical engineering paved the way for a new method of creating synthetic muscles. Instead of creating something that closely imitated the functionality of human muscle, scientists discovered a way of forcing the human body itself to augment its own muscle tissue using both synthetic and organic materials. This is typically done using gene therapy or chemical injections.
