BitNode-1: Source Genesis

Source-File Level: 1 / 3



Difficulty: easy



The first BitNode created by the Enders to imprison the minds of humans. It became the prototype and testing-grounds for all of the BitNodes that followed.

This is the first BitNode that you play through. It has no special modifications or mechanics.

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 1, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File lets the player start with 32GB of RAM on his/her home computer when entering a new BitNode, and also increases all of the player's multipliers by:

Level 1: 16%
Level 2: 24%
Level 3: 28%

BitNode-2: Rise of the Underworld

Source-File Level: 0 / 3



Difficulty: easy



From the shadows, they rose.

Organized crime groups quickly filled the void of power left behind from the collapse of Western government in the 2050s. As society and civilization broke down, people quickly succumbed to the innate human impulse of evil and savagery. The organized crime factions quickly rose to the top of the modern world.

In this BitNode:

Your hacking level is reduced by 20%
The growth rate and maximum amount of money available on servers are significantly decreased
The amount of money gained from crimes and Infiltration is tripled
Certain Factions (Slum Snakes, Tetrads, The Syndicate, The Dark Army, Speakers for the Dead, NiteSec, The Black Hand) give the player the ability to form and manage their own gangs. These gangs will earn the player money and reputation with the corresponding Faction
Every Augmentation in the game will be available through the Factions listed above
For every Faction NOT listed above, reputation gains are halved
You will no longer gain passive reputation with Factions

Destroying this BitNode will give you Source-File 2, or if you already have this Source-File it will upgrade its level up to a maximum of 3. This Source-File allows you to form gangs in other BitNodes once your karma decreases to a certain value. It also increases the player's crime success rate, crime money, and charisma multipliers by:

Level 1: 24%
Level 2: 36%
Level 3: 42%
