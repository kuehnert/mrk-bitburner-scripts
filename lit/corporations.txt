The Complete Handbook for Creating a Successful Corporation

Getting Started with Corporations
To get started, visit the City Hall in Sector-12 in order to create a Corporation. This requires $150b of your own money, but this $150b will get put into your Corporation's funds. Your Corporation can have many different divisions, each in a different Industry. There are many different types of Industries, each with different properties. To create your first division, click the 'Expand into new Industry' button at the top of the management UI. The Agriculture and Software industries are recommended for your first division.

The first thing you'll need to do is hire some employees. Employees can be assigned to five different positions. Each position has a different effect on various aspects of your Corporation. It is recommended to have at least one employee at each position.

Each industry uses some combination of Materials in order to produce other Materials and/or create Products. Specific information about this is displayed in each of your divisions' UI.

Products are special, industry-specific objects. They are different than Materials because you must manually choose to develop them, and you can choose to develop any number of Products. Developing a Product takes time, but a Product typically generates significantly more revenue than any Material. Not all industries allow you to create Products. To create a Product, look for a button in the top-left panel of the division UI (e.g. For the Software Industry, the button says 'Develop Software').

To get your supply chain system started, purchase the Materials that your industry needs to produce other Materials/Products. This can be done by clicking the 'Buy' button next to the corresponding Material(s). After you have the required Materials, you will immediately start production. The amount of Materials/Products you produce is based on a variety of factors, one of which is your employees and their productivity.

Once you start producing Materials/Products, you can sell them in order to start earning revenue. This can be done by clicking the 'Sell' button next to the corresponding Material or Product. The amount of Material/Product you sell is dependent on a wide variety of different factors.

These are the basics of getting your Corporation up and running! Now, you can start purchasing upgrades to improve your bottom line. If you need money, consider looking for seed investors, who will give you money in exchange for stock shares. Otherwise, once you feel you are ready, take your Corporation public! Once your Corporation goes public, you can no longer find investors. Instead, your Corporation will be publicly traded and its stock price will change based on how well it's performing financially. You can then sell your stock shares in order to make money.

Tips/Pointers
-The 'Smart Supply' upgrade is extremely useful. Consider purchasing it as soon as possible.

-Purchasing Hardware, Robots, AI Cores, and Real Estate can potentially increase your production. The effects of these depend on what industry you are in.

-In order to optimize your production, you will need a good balance of Operators, Managers, and Engineers

-Different employees excel in different jobs. For example, the highly intelligent employees will probably do best if they are assigned to do Engineering work or Research & Development.

-If your employees have low morale, energy, or happiness, their production will greatly suffer.

-Tech is important, but don't neglect sales! Having several Businessmen can boost your sales and your bottom line.

-Don't forget to advertise your company. You won't have any business if nobody knows you.

-Having company awareness is great, but what's really important is your company's popularity. Try to keep your popularity as high as possible to see the biggest benefit for your sales

-Remember, you need to spend money to make money!

-Corporations do not reset when installing Augmentations, but they do reset when destroying a BitNode
