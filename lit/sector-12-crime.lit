Figures Show Rising Crime Rates in Sector-12

A recent study by analytics company Wilson Inc. shows a significant rise in criminal activity in Sector-12. Perhaps the most alarming part of the statistic is that most of the rise is in violent crime such as homicide and assault. According to the study, the city saw a total of 21,406 reported homicides in 2076, which is over a 20% increase compared to 2075.

CIA director David Glarow says its too early to know whether these figures indicate the beginning of a sustained increase in crime rates, or whether the year was just an unfortunate outlier. He states that many intelligence and law enforcement agents have noticed an increase in organized crime activites, and believes that these figures may be the result of an uprising from criminal organizations such as The Syndicate or the Slum Snakes.
