The New Triads

The Triads were an ancient transnational crime syndicate based in China, Hong Kong, and other Asian territories. They were often considered one of the first and biggest criminal secret societies. While most of the branches of the Triads have been destroyed over the past few decades, the crime faction has spawned and inspired a number of other Asian crime organizations over the past few years. The most notable of these is the Tetrads.

It is widely believed that the Tetrads are a rogue group that splintered off from the Triads sometime in the mid 21st century. The founders of the Tetrads, all of whom were ex-Triad members, believed that the Triads were losing their purpose and direction. The Tetrads started off as a small group that mainly engaged in fraud and extortion. They were largely unknown until just a few years ago when they took over the illegal drug trade in all of the major Asian cities. They quickly became the most powerful crime syndicate in the continent.

Not much else is known about the Tetrads, or about the efforts the Asian governments and corporations are making to take down this large new crime organization. Many believe that the Tetrads have infiltrated the governments and powerful corporations in Asia, which has helped faciliate their recent rapid rise.
