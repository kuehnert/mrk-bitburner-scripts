Tensions rise in global tech race

Have we entered a new Cold War? Is WWIII just beyond the horizon?

After rumors came out that OmniTek Incorporated had begun developing advanced robotic supersoldiers, geopolitical tensions quickly flared between the USA, Russia, and several Asian superpowers. In a rare show of cooperation between corporations, MegaCorp and ECorp have reportedly launched hundreds of new surveillance and espionage satellites. Defense contractors such as DeltaOne and AeroCorp have been working with the CIA and NSA to prepare for conflict. Meanwhile, the rest of the world sits in earnest hoping that it never reaches full-scale war. With today's technology and firepower, a World War would assuredly mean the end of human civilization.
