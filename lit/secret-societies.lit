Secret Societies

The idea of secret societies has long intrigued the general public by inspiring curiosity, fascination, and distrust. People have long wondered about who these secret society members are and what they do, with the most radical of conspiracy theorists claiming that they control everything in the entire world. And while the world may never know for sure, it is likely that many secret societies do actually exist, even today.

However, the secret societies of the modern world are nothing like those that (supposedly) existed decades and centuries ago. The Freemasons, Knights Templar, and Illuminati, while they may have been around at the turn of the 21st century, almost assuredly do not exist today. The dominance of the Web in our everyday lives and the fact that so much of the world is now digital has given rise to a new breed of secret societies: Internet-based ones.

Commonly called 'hacker groups', Internet-based secret societies have become well-known in today's world. Some of these, such as The Black Hand, are black hat groups that claim they are trying to help the oppressed by attacking the elite and powerful. Others, such as NiteSec, are hacktivist groups that try to push political and social agendas. Perhaps the most intriguing hacker group is the mysterious Bitrunners, whose purpose still remains unknown.
