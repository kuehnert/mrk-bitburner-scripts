Space: The Failed Frontier

Humans have long dreamed about spaceflight. With enduring interest, we were driven to explore the unknown and discover new worlds. We dreamed about conquering the stars. And in our quest, we pushed the boundaries of our scientific limits, and then pushed further. Space exploration lead to the development of many important technologies and new industries.

But sometime in the middle of the 21st century, all of that changed. Humanity lost its ambitions and aspirations of exploring the cosmos. The once-large funding for agencies like NASA and the European Space Agency gradually whittled away until their eventual disbanding in the 2060's. Not even militaries are fielding flights into space nowadays. The only remnants of the once great mission for cosmic conquest are the countless satellites in near-earth orbit, used for communications, espionage, and other corporate interests.

And as we continue to look at the state of space technology, it becomes more and more apparent that we will never return to that golden age of space exploration, that age where everyone dreamed of going beyond earth for the sake of discovery.
